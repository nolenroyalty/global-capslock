## QUESTIONS

### WHY DO THIS
I WANTED us to all agree about caps lock usage

### will this break MY COMPUTER
IDK JUST MAKE SURE YOU KNOW how to stop a procesS BEFORE RUNNING IT

### HOW WELL TESTED IS THIS
NO TESTS i wrote most of it over thE WEEKEND BUT I TESTED IT ON EACH PLATFORM ONE TO THREE TIMES

### WHAT PLATFORMS ARE SUPPORTED
mAC, wINDOWS, AND lINUX. BUt Linux requires that you insTALL `xdotool` SO MAKE SURE TO DO THAT

### HOW TO INSTALL??

DOWNLOAD CODE. THEN INSTALL `xdotool` IF ON lINUX. THen

either:
* use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) which might handle everything for you
* `uv run client.py` oR SOMETHING IDK IF YOU USE UV YOU KNOW THIS

OR

* CREATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
* ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENVIronment
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python client.py`
